<p>Earlier in this series of posts, we talked about how public cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) differ from the private cloud in that the <a href="https://applatix.com/aws-public-cloud-not-equal-private-cloud/">public cloud is API based</a> and <a href="https://applatix.com/aws-instance-not-vm/">AWS instances are different than VMs</a>.</p>
<p>We also argued that DevOps is the key to success in the public cloud and how we think <a href="https://applatix.com/public-vs-private-cloud-silos-vs-devops/">DevOps differs in the public vs. private cloud</a>.</p>
<p>But what is DevOps? This has been a heated topic in the past with a different answer in just about every article or book you might read in your daily newsfeed.</p>
<p>We think it’s helpful to think of types of definitions based on the domain of the audience. For example, here are how three types of people might define DevOps.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
	<li>“DevOps is Continuous Delivery to enable business agility”- a business definition.</li>
	<li>“DevOps = CI + CD + automated Testing + configuration management + deployment” - a process definition.</li>
	<li>“DevOps is a culture” - an analyst, pundit or consultant definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, DevOps is all of the above!</p>
<p>Our own definition is - <em>DevOps is an end-to-end process of continuous enhancement in the cloud - from check-in to production – where a feature is available to a customer with continuous monitoring and improvement</em>.</p>
<p>We think this is where most DevOps teams will likely end up spending a lot of time building and integrating tools. Building an <em>integrated system</em> that <em>automates</em> the DevOps process and <em>drives continuous improvement</em>.</p>
<p>To illustrate - we think a good analogy for an integrated DevOps system is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfsNz-vUoqA">CNC machine</a> for machining aluminum.  It’s a complete end-to-end system that you drive with a standard spec that is constantly using feedback to make course corrections and improve quality and efficiency.</p>
<p>But regardless of your definition, DevOps is a must if you want to use the public cloud effectively.</p>
<p>In our next blog entry, we will drill into the role of containers in enabling DevOps and public cloud success.</p>
