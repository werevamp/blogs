    <p>Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Applatix, Inc..</p>
    <p>Applatix, Inc. acknowledges Customer’s claim, and Customer hereby represents and warrants that Customer owns any data, information or material originated by Customer that Customer submits or compiles in the course of using the Services (“Customer Data”).

    <p>If at any time Customer is exceeding the Usage Rights, Applatix, Inc. shall notify Customer and Customer shall bring its usage within the limits of such Usage Rights.

    <p><strong>6. Term and Termination</strong></p>
    <p>The Agreement shall commence as of the date set forth in the first Order and, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, shall remain in effect through the end of the Subscription Term in any current Order. All sections of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive, including without limitation, accrued rights to payment, use restrictions and indemnity obligations, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
    <p>In the event of a material breach by either party, the non-breaching party shall have the right to terminate the applicable Order for cause if such breach has not been cured within 30 days of written notice from the non-breaching party specifying the breach in detail. Applatix, Inc. may immediately suspend Customer’s password, account, and access to the Services if (i)</p>
    <p>Customer fails to make payment due within ten business days after Applatix, Inc. has provided.</p>
    <p>Customer with notice of such failure; or (ii) Customer violates Section 2, 3, or 9 of these Terms and Conditions. Any suspension by Applatix, Inc. of the Services under the preceding sentence shall not relieve Customer of its payment obligations under the Agreement. If Applatix, Inc. terminates an Order for Customer’s material breach, all fees set forth on such Order will remain due and payable in accordance with the applicable payment terms described in Section V above.</p>
    <p>Upon any termination or expiration of an Order, Customer’s right to access and use the Services covered by that Order shall terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Customer’s request if received within 30 days of termination of the Order, Applatix, Inc. will permit Customer to access the Services solely to the extent necessary for Customer to retrieve a file of Customer Data then in Applatix, Inc.’s possession.

Customer must notify Applatix, Inc. of any of the above-described warranty deficiencies within 30 days from performance of the relevant Services in order to receive warranty remedies.</p>
    <p>For breach of the express warranty set forth above, Customer’s exclusive remedy shall be the re-performance of the deficient Services in a conforming manner, or if Applatix, Inc. cannot re-perform such deficient Services as warranted, Customer shall be entitled to recover the fees paid to Applatix, Inc. attributable to such deficient Services, and such refund shall be Applatix, Inc.’s entire liability.</p>
    <p>The Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for unscheduled emergency maintenance, or because of other causes beyond Applatix, Inc.’s reasonable control, but Applatix, Inc. shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled unavailability of the Services and to minimize the duration and impact of any such downtime.</p>
    <p>Applatix, Inc. shall defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless against any loss, damage or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with claims, demands, suits, or proceedings (“Claims”) made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that the use of the Service as contemplated hereunder infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party; provided, that Customer (a) promptly gives written notice of the Claim to Applatix, Inc.; (b) givesApplatix, Inc. sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Applatix, Inc. may not settle or defend any Claim unless it unconditionally releases Customer of all liability); and (c) provides to Applatix, Inc., at Applatix, Inc.’s cost, all reasonable assistance.</p>

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, APPLATIX, INC. AND ITS THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT (A) THE OPERATION OR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; OR (B) THE QUALITY OF THE, SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER APPLATIX, INC. NOR ITS THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS CONTROLS THE TRANSFER OF DATA OVER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, AND THAT THE SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF SUCH COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.

    <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
    <p>EXCEPT FOR A PARTY’S BREACH OF SECTION IX (CONFIDENTIALITY), OR CLAIMS OF BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, NEITHER PARTY OR ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE, INACCURACY OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND IT’S REASONABLE CONTROL, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE; OR (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE LESSER OF $500,000 OR THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER IN THE PRECEEDING 12 MONTHS.

    <p><strong>9. .Confidential Information</strong></p>
    <p>Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information” of the Disclosing Party). Such information includes, without limitation, Customer Data, information related to Customer’s login identifiers and credentials for Accounts and the nature and performance of Customer’s marketing programs. The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information; and (ii) not to use (except as expressly permitted in Section 10 below) or divulge to any third person any such Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to Confidential Information after five years following the termination of the Agreement or any Confidential Information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party; or (d) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (e) is required by law. Customer Data will be destroyed as set forth in Section 6.3, and, upon Customer’s request, Applatix, Inc. shall certify to such destruction in writing.</p>
    <p><strong>10. Statistical Information</strong></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement or otherwise, Applatix, Inc. may monitor Customer’s use of the Services on a non-Customer-specific, aggregate, anonymous basis and use on a non-Customer-specific, aggregate, anonymous Customer Data according to the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Applatix, Inc. may give notice to Customer by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to Customer’s address on record in Applatix, Inc.’s account information. If Customer has a dispute with Applatix, Inc., wishes to provide a notice under the Agreement, or becomes subject to insolvency or other similar legal proceedings, Customer shall promptly send written notice to Applatix, Inc. at 111. W. Evelyn avenue, Sunnyvale CA 94806.</p>
    <p><strong>11. Force Majeure.</strong></p>
    <p>Neither party shall be responsible for failure or delay of performance if caused by: an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; act of God; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage that is not caused by the obligated party; government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export or other license); or other event outside the reasonable control of the obligated party. Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event. If such event continues for more than 20 days, either party may cancel unperformed Services upon written notice. This section does not excuse either party of its obligations to take reasonable steps to follow its normal disaster recovery procedures or Customer’s obligation to pay for the Services provided (although payment due dates will be extended, as appropriate).</p>
    <p><strong>12.  General provisions</strong></p>
    <p>Any action, Claim, or dispute related to the Agreement will be governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and controlling U.S. federal law. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to the Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing. Except for actions for nonpayment or breach of either party’s proprietary rights, no action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to the Agreement may be brought by either party more than two years after the cause of action has accrued.</p>
    <p>The Agreement and all Order(s), represent the parties’ entire understanding relating to the Services, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications. The exchange of a fully executed Order by fax or electronic signature shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the Terms and Conditions of the Agreement and such Order. The Agreement may be amended only by written agreement of the parties. If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Applatix, Inc. and Customer as a result of the Agreement or use of the Services. Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written approval of the other, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such approval shall not be required in connection with a merger or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the assigning company. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.</p>

<p>Neither party shall be responsible for failure or delay of performance if caused by: an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; act of God; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage that is not caused by the obligated party; government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export or other license); or other event outside the reasonable control of the obligated party. Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event. If such event continues for more than 20 days, either party may cancel unperformed Services upon written notice. This section does not excuse either party of its obligations to take reasonable steps to follow its normal disaster recovery procedures or Customer’s obligation to pay for the Services provided (although payment due dates will be extended, as appropriate).</p>

<ol>
<li> General provisions</li>
</ol>

<p>Any action, Claim, or dispute related to the Agreement will be governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and controlling U.S. federal law. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to the Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing. Except for actions for nonpayment or breach of either party’s proprietary rights, no action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to the Agreement may be brought by either party more than two years after the cause of action has accrued.</p>

<p>The Agreement and all Order(s), represent the parties’ entire understanding relating to the Services, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications. The exchange of a fully executed Order by fax or electronic signature shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the Terms and Conditions of the Agreement and such Order. The Agreement may be amended only by written agreement of the parties. If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.</p>

<p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Applatix, Inc. and Customer as a result of the Agreement or use of the Services. Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written approval of the other, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such approval shall not be required in connection with a merger or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the assigning company. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.</p>
