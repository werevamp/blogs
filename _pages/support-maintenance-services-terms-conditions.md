<p>To the extent Applatix has become obligated for support and maintenance, the following will apply with respect to software Products so long as they remain Applatix’s standard terms and the Licensee is in full compliance with the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in Section 6 below have the same meaning as in Applatix’s standard Software License Terms.</p>
<ol>
	<li>SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES. Support and Maintenance Services consist of (a) Error Correction and Telephone Support provided to a single consistent technical support contact concerning the installation and use of the then current release of a Product and the Previous Sequential Release, (b) E-mail Support, (c) Web Support, and (d) Product updates that Applatix in its discretion makes generally available to its support and maintenance customers without additional charge.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li>INCIDENT PRIORITY LEVELS. Applatix shall exercise commercially reasonable to correct any Error reported by Licensee in the current unmodified release of Product in accordance with the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by Applatix.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incident Priority Incident priority for a defect is determined using the guidelines below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Priority P1 Incidents - Applatix shall respond within one business day and promptly commence the following procedures: (i) assign Applatix engineers to correct the Error; (ii) notify Applatix management that such Errors have been reported and of steps being taken to correct such Error(s); (iii) provide Licensee with periodic reports on the status of the corrections; and (iv) initiate work to provide Licensee with a Workaround or Fix.</li>
	<li>Priority P2 Incidents - Applatix shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to include the Fix for the Error in the next regular Product maintenance release.</li>
	<li>Priority P3 and P4 Incidents - Applatix may include the Fix for the Error in the next major release of the Product.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Applatix believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Error in a Product, Applatix will so notify Licensee. At that time, Licensee may (1) instruct Applatix to proceed with problem determination at its possible expense as set forth below, or (2) instruct Applatix that Licensee does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense. If Licensee requests that Applatix proceed with problem determination at its possible expense and Applatix determines that the error was not due to an Error in the Product, Licensee shall pay Applatix, at Applatix’s then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred therewith. Licensee shall not be liable for (i) problem determination or repair to the extent problems are due to Errors in the Product; or (ii) work performed under this paragraph in excess of its instructions; or (iii) work performed after Licensee has notified Applatix that it no longer wishes work on the problem determination to be continued at its possible expense (such notice shall be deemed given when actually received by Applatix). If Licensee instructs Applatix that it does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense or if such determination requires effort in excess of Licensee’s instructions, Applatix may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the error with no liability therefor.</p>
